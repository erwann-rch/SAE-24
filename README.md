# BUT RT1 - SAE24 - 2021/22

In this SAE we were asked to code a sniffer over three common but insecure application protocols (FTP, Telnet and HTTP).

On the FTP connection a file was transferred containing an enhanced Caesar cipher, an encryption that increments the shift key by 1 for each character. I decrypted this message using the Cesar.py file. 

All protocols have a sniff and file (.pcapng) version .
All the sniff files have been combined in a single program able to detect which connection is active, this is where Fran√ßois.py comes in, a very smart friend of Titeuf who has the particularity to have a big nose (related to the sniffer).

NB: It is better to launch the files from a terminal.
